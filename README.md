# Predicting House Prices. 


We decided to explore the [Ames dataset]( http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock.pdf) in order to predict house prices. Our model consisted of a Ridge Regression with regularization and it achieve a RMSLE of approximately .099 in the test set. 

The notebook with the final pipeline can be found [here](https://github.com/EnriqueOrtiz27/predicting-house-prices/blob/main/Enrique/contest_pipeline.ipynb).
